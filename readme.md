# DISCORD STAFF POLICY & MODERATION OVERVIEW

### 1. Purpose and Scope  
This policy governs the roles, responsibilities, and conduct of all Discord staff members operating within the Fate community platform. It aims to ensure a safe, respectful, and well-moderated environment for all users aged 13 and above. Fate strictly prohibits dating or romantic solicitation on the platform; it is designed solely to facilitate platonic friendships.

---

### 2. Definition of Discord Staff  
Discord staff (“Staff”) are individuals appointed by Fate based on merit, trustworthiness, and demonstrated positive contributions. Staff include moderators, community managers, developers, and testers. There is no public application process; all appointments are discretionary and at the sole judgment of Fate leadership.

---

### 3. Roles and Responsibilities  
Staff are entrusted with the following duties:

- **Rule Enforcement:** Apply community guidelines impartially and consistently. This includes monitoring content and user behavior to detect and prevent violations.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Mediate disputes and de-escalate tensions among users in a fair, respectful manner.
- **Safety Assurance:** Identify, report, and act on threats to user safety, including harassment, predatory behavior, underage activity, or attempts at rule evasion.
- **User Support:** Provide timely assistance to user inquiries and concerns.
- **Collaboration:** Work closely with the development team to test new features, improve moderation tools, and incorporate community feedback.
- **Confidentiality:** Maintain strict confidentiality regarding user data, internal decisions, and sensitive reports.

### 4. Moderation Philosophy  
Fate employs a “reasoned judgment” approach emphasizing user intent and impact over literal rule infractions. Staff have the discretion to act against users who engage in bad-faith behavior, harassment, repeated boundary-pushing, or otherwise harm the community atmosphere, even if technical rules are not explicitly broken.

- **Priority:** User safety and well-being are paramount.
- **Proportionality:** Sanctions are appropriate to the severity and recurrence of the violation.
- **Transparency:** Users affected by moderation actions are provided explanations, subject to privacy considerations.
