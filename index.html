  <h1>DISCORD STAFF POLICY & MODERATION OVERVIEW</h1>

  <h3>1. Purpose and Scope</h3>
  <p>
    This policy governs the roles, responsibilities, and conduct of all Discord staff members operating within the Fate community platform. 
    It aims to ensure a safe, respectful, and well-moderated environment for all users aged 13 and above. 
    Fate strictly prohibits dating or romantic solicitation on the platform; it is designed solely to facilitate platonic friendships.
  </p>
  <hr>

  <h3>2. Definition of Discord Staff</h3>
  <p>
    Discord staff (“Staff”) are individuals appointed by Fate based on merit, trustworthiness, and demonstrated positive contributions. 
    Staff include moderators, community managers, developers, and testers. 
    There is no public application process; all appointments are discretionary and at the sole judgment of Fate leadership.
  </p>
  <hr>

  <h3>3. Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
  <p>Staff are entrusted with the following duties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rule Enforcement:</strong> Apply community guidelines impartially and consistently. This includes monitoring content and user behavior to detect and prevent violations.</li>
    <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Mediate disputes and de-escalate tensions among users in a fair, respectful manner.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety Assurance:</strong> Identify, report, and act on threats to user safety, including harassment, predatory behavior, underage activity, or attempts at rule evasion.</li>
    <li><strong>User Support:</strong> Provide timely assistance to user inquiries and concerns.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Work closely with the development team to test new features, improve moderation tools, and incorporate community feedback.</li>
    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Maintain strict confidentiality regarding user data, internal decisions, and sensitive reports.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>

  <h3>4. Moderation Philosophy</h3>
  <p>
    Fate employs a “reasoned judgment” approach emphasizing user intent and impact over literal rule infractions. 
    Staff have the discretion to act against users who engage in bad-faith behavior, harassment, repeated boundary-pushing, 
    or otherwise harm the community atmosphere, even if technical rules are not explicitly broken.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Priority:</strong> User safety and well-being are paramount.</li>
    <li><strong>Proportionality:</strong> Sanctions are appropriate to the severity and recurrence of the violation.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Users affected by moderation actions are provided explanations, subject to privacy considerations.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>

  <h3>5. Staff Authority and Limitations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Issue warnings, timeouts, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans.</li>
    <li>Remove or restrict content deemed harmful or violating platform policies.</li>
    <li>Enforce rules based on the spirit of the guidelines, beyond the literal wording.</li>
    <li>Escalate critical incidents to senior management or legal authorities as appropriate.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Staff must not abuse their authority, engage in favoritism, or disclose confidential information.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>6. Transparency and Accountability</h3>
